# Open questions

Not gaps against the design — the design never asked for these. Noticed
using Atenea day to day, not yet decided, written down as they came up so the
next session starts from this instead of memory. An entry leaves this list
by being answered, not by quietly falling off it.

## Channels that leave no trace on disk

Three separate surfaces moved on 2026-08-13 with nothing written down anywhere
a later reader could find. One pattern, not three incidents:

- the 49 `mcp__claude_ai_*` connectors, attached to the claude.ai account and
  named in no file on the machine;
- the `ListAgents` built-in, which appeared on the wire inside a fifteen-minute
  window with no local file touched and no binary upgraded;
- claude-mem mounted twice per omp session. **omp records nothing about MCP
  spawns**: 67 log files from that day, zero lines mentioning a server
  starting. The proof that two backends existed rather than one came from
  `/proc` — live parentage and start times — and would have vanished with the
  next restart.

The open question is not how to log more. It is which of these channels should
be *required* to leave a trace, and which are honestly unobservable and must
therefore be measured on demand and reported with a date. `mcp-agree` answers
the third case today by counting routes on the wire; the first two it can only
timestamp. Deciding that split is the work, and it belongs before the next
instrument is written, not after it reports green.

## Root multiplication in Dart projects

omp creates one `dart-analyze` and one `dart-test` per detected root
(`for (const _ of roots)`). `~/Desktop/taxiprime-app` holds seven
`pubspec.yaml`, four of them inside `.upgrade-backups/`. Unverified whether
that directory is excluded; if it is not, stale copies of an app are analysed
on every run. Cost is processes and wall clock, not tokens. Noticed while
retiring the Dart MCP check, which defended against a different failure.
